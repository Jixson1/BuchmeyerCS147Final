# BuchmeyerCS147Final
1. I spent just about 11 hours on this project.
2. From working on this project, I learned many things about Unity's NavMesh library. I learned the intricacies of the library and found that it could be used for a wide variety of different game genres. I also learned a decent bit of C# syntax and more about the general functionality of Unity, specifically when it comes to audio sources. I also delved into some camera work where I figured out how to switch cameras based on the state of the game.
3. On a scale from 0-100 I believe I earned a solid 90. I think what keeps me from reaching any higher mark is that despite putting in a solid amount of time into learning NavMesh and developing this project, the total outcome isn't something INCREDIBLE. If I were able to put in more time to this, (which I might when I have more free time :P), I would add more things to the game such as an enemy that chases you around using the NavMesh surface as its guide, and I could also add more levels. I would also refine the game in ways such as adding a main or start menu instead of just throwing the player into the game. Also, I did not exactly use everything I learned from tutorials in this project such as NavMesh links which allow the player character to jump between NavMesh surfaces. Adding this to my game could lead to more complex level design.
